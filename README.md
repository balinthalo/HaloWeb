## About HaloWeb

A simple forum engine based on the Laravel framework. Easy to install and easy to use after registration. We can categorize posts and manage comments. With permission levels, we can ensure the proper content context of our forum, including administrative and moderator tasks.

- Email-based registration and authentication
- Topics, Posts, Comments
- Administrator, Moderator, User, Guest (unregistered visitor)
- Ability to edit, format, close, and delete already written messages and posts

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
